The GDELT Project is the largest, most comprehensive open database of human society ever created. Its Event Database archives contain nearly 400M latitude/longitude geographic coordinates spanning over 12,900 days making it one of the largest public spatio-temporal datasets in existence. GDELT uses sophisticated natural language and data mining algorithms to extract more than 300 categories of events and the networks of people, organizations, locations, themes, and emotions that tie them together. It is also one of the largest real-time streaming news machine translation deployments in the world covering global news in 65 languages. GDELT truly pushes the boundaries of big data, weighing in at over a quarter-billion rows with 59 fields for each record across the entire planet for more than 35 years.
